# PSOT Compose
Generate deliverables from a central source of truth.

Deliverables being out of sync is one of the major concerns in many (especially larger) projects. The purpose of PSOT is to generate deliverables from a central source of truth for your project. This will ensure all deliverables are in sync for each set you generate.
